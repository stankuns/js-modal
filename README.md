# Project Name
> a modal component

## General info
This is an exercise where I learned how to make this component, a modal (or a dialog), a component thatâ€™s invisible to the eyes at first, part of Zell Liew's Learn JavaScript course (lessons  Modal: Building a Modal; Modal: Closing the modal; Modal: Animating the modal; Modal: Animating the pointing hand and; Modal: Animating the waving hand).

## Inspiration
A simple exercise that shows how JavaScript working together with CCS can also be a simple thing to make a website better.

## Technologies
* HTML - 5
* CSS - 3
* JavaScript - ES6

## Status
It was realised and customised with a few pieces of information from a website I recently worked on, kollektivorort.
